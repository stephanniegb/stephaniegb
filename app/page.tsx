              Hey there! I'm Stephanie, a curious developer who loves bringing
              ideas to life with fun, stunning, and accessible web experiences.
              Whether it's about making interfaces pop or ensuring the code runs
              like clockwork, I'm all in for the magic behind the screen!
            </p>

            <p>
              I'm currently a Frontend Developer at{" "}
              <a href="https://www.horuslabs.co/">Horus Labs</a>, where I build
              and maintain high-performance user interfaces that not only look
              amazing but also meet web accessibility standards. My focus is on
              creating seamless and inclusive experiences, especially in the
              exciting world of Web3.
            </p>
            <p>
              I'm passionate about learning and pushing myself beyond my current
              limits. In the past, I've worked with finance companies, startups,
              and personal projects that have taught me invaluable lessons. Each
              experience has fueled my growth, and I'm excited to keep
              exploring, experimenting, and leveling up.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not learning, you'll find me dancing, spending quality
              time with my family, or exploring new placesâ€”I love how traveling
              adds so much color to life. Lately, I've also been diving into
              cooking, and it's been such a fun and delicious adventure!
